            <p>We’ve accumulated nearly all of the world’s knowledge online, but we forget how much of that data is personal. Today’s Web is dominated by Hooli and a handful of other tech companies that have built their fortunes tracking massive amounts of our data — photos, status updates, location check-ins, web cookies, and more.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>So the question becomes: What do these tech companies do with all of this personal information? So as not to violate several NDAs I was forced to sign upon my exit from Hooli, I can only speak generally: It’s not pretty. They exploit your online activity and preferences for profit. They sell your data to advertisers. You become the product.  </p>
        <p>That’s why we at Pied Piper are building a decentralized internet — one which takes power from these megacorporations and gives it back to you, the netizens.</p>

            <div class="photo who-we-are-info" data-bio="&lt;p&gt;Richard is the Founder of Pied Piper, and after a brief hiatus, is once again CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While Richard has worn a few different hats at Pied Piper, his compression algorithm — an algorithm some have called a game-changing technology worth seeing through to its greatest potential to impact the world — has always been his guiding light. He is now focusing on a new project. He still can’t go into specifics at this time, but let’s just say it’s going to be pretty big, and not crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Richard first moved to Silicon Valley to study computer science at Stanford. He left four credits shy of graduation to concentrate on his true passion: compressing data. He created Pied Piper to pursue that passion and bring his middle-out algorithm to all. He and his team launched the Pied Piper platform earlier this year, which didn’t quite catch on with the public, but that was no reflection on the tech. The tech remains revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In his spare time, Richard meditates on the value of innovation over wealth and popularity. He also enjoys amateur astronomy, and taking brief dips in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;">

&lt;p&gt;Jared first joined the company as Head of Business Development, but is over the sun, moon, and stars to have recently been promoted to Chief Operating Officer.

He briefly served as CEO of PiperChat, Pied Piper’s video chat offshoot. Following Hooli’s acquisition of PiperChat, Dinesh gracefully parted ways with the company and thinks it’s best not to talk about it too much anymore. Dinesh has also contributed to a pioneering image classification project at Periscope, scraping the internet of inappropriate content. He doesn’t like to talk about that too much, either.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Prior to working in Silicon Valley, Dinesh received degrees in information theory and computer science from Yale, Caltech, and Oxford, and published several books on advanced Java tools. (Signed copies available upon request.) When he&#39;s not coding or kicking it with his boys, Dinesh enjoys online solitaire and the occasional karaoke session.&lt;/p&gt;">

It took them a week to get it down. You’re welcome. He has played drums in various Toronto-area first-wave-DC-influenced hardcore, thrashcore, hatecore, corecore and corehard outfits under the name Strychnine McTwat. In fact, he has been asked to leave some of the most influential bands in the Toronto scene, including Piss Nazis, the Scumtones and Das Abortions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non serviam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;">

He is currently a co-principal at Bachmanity Enterprises, which is now the principal owner of Pied Piper. Is that weird, using the word “principal” like that twice in the same sentence, but in kind of two different senses? It feels weird.

<p class="p1">I’ve gone by many names throughout my life: Donald, Jared, Child #61728. But this week I earned myself a new one: the Dorian Gray of Silicon Valley. For I let my vanity make a monster of me.</p>
<p class="p1">It all started when I joined Richard for an interview on Bloomberg. I’d only come for moral support, but then Emily Chang started asking me questions, and the interview went live, and all of a sudden I was being asked to do Adrian Grenier’s edutainment web series. I hadn’t even planned to watch the Bloomberg interview, but Dinesh convinced me to review the footage to improve before my next appearance. He said it was for the good of the company! Little did I realize that to watch a YouTube clip of oneself on repeat is the digital equivalent of Narcissus’s unwavering gaze into the water.</p>
<p class="p1">Such began my stumble into the depths of shallowness. I’d never considered myself a superficial person before. I put care into my appearance, of course, but only as a gesture toward professionalism. (To show up in anything short of combed hair, pressed khakis, and a lint-free fleece vest is disrespectful.) And sure, I’ve humbly accepted a few comparisons to movie star Anthony Perkins, but I always thought that was more about our shared love of birds than anything else. But now, before I knew it, I was fretting over my nose, demanding lip injections to distract from it. I thought they would have a subtle, bee-stung look, but there was more truth in that syringe than saline. My lips had grown as inflated as my new ego.</p>
<p class="p1">Even though the doctor told me the puffiness will subside after twenty-four hours, I think the effects on the computer education students at Paul Revere Middle School may last longer than that. How must they feel, knowing I chose Grenier over them? That I chased a shiny piece of Turkish delight instead of the home cooked meal of their company? Those kids depend on me to teach them about life in tech, to share stories of my past bullying, no matter how tangentially related to the day’s lesson. At least they got to meet Richard. The photos I’d shown them in class could only do him so much justice.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, readers, it’s time to repair the damage our network suffered this week, ice my lips again, and look inward. Until next time!</p>

            <p><span>Before</span> Pied Piper envisioned a new internet, it was a simple app to detect infringement of music copyrights – a side project of lowly Hooli employee Richard Hendricks.

            <br><span>Once</span> others caught wind of the promise of his algorithm, Richard found himself in the middle of a bidding war between two of the Valley’s major players. Hooli CEO Gavin Belson pounced with a ten million dollar acquisition offer, while VC Peter Gregory offered a $200,000 seed round to start a new company. The stress of the decision took a physical toll on Richard, but in the end he picked Gregory and the power to see his tech through to its fullest potential.
            <br><span>With</span> the backing of Gregory’s fund Raviga, Hendricks assembled his team: Dinesh Chugtai, Bertram Gilfoyle, and Jared Dunn, all working together out of Erlich Bachman’s incubator. The company’s first great test came at TechCrunch Disrupt. After a challenge from Hooli’s compression competitor Nucleus, Richard pulled an all-nighter to invent a new approach to compression: middle-out. In the finals of the competition, Richard’s middle-out algorithm surpassed the theoretical limit and achieved the highest Weissman score ever recorded. Pied Piper took first place at Disrupt.

Their champion Peter Gregory passed away and Gavin Belson slapped the team with a massive lawsuit, rendering them damaged goods to all potential investors. Fortunately, Richard came across Russ Hanneman, the one man in the Valley who didn’t wince at impending litigation.
            <br><span>After</span> a string of failed deals with energy drink Homicide and adult content producer Intersite, a condor egg live stream changed everything. The feed of the egg went viral when a camera technician fell forty feet into a ravine, and Pied Piper’s durability under the traffic proved the strength of the tech. The good news seemed to continue from there: Pied Piper defeated Gavin’s frivolous lawsuit, and Raviga’s new head VC Laurie Bream bought Hanneman out of Pied Piper.

          <div class="content4">
            <p><span>Despite</span> being in full control of Pied Piper for the first time since its inception, Richard found himself uninspired by what he was building. To Richard, PiperChat was a trivial application of his revolutionary middle-out compression algorithm. So Richard left Pied Piper to tackle a brave new venture: launching a decentralized internet.
            <br><span>PiperChat</span> dissolved soon after and the rest of the team joined Richard’s new project. The next obstacle: securing the patent to the peer-to-peer network Richard dreamed of, which, unfortunately, belonged to Gavin Belson. Gavin and Richard embarked on an unlikely partnership, but it didn’t last long – Belson went to Tibet to find himself, and gave Richard full ownership of the patent.
            <br><span>With</span> Gavin off in Tibet, Richard turned to customers for funding. Pied Piper landed a data storage deal with Fiduciated General Insurance and launched Space Saver, an app to maximize mobile storage that would help build out the Pied Piper network of devices. Space Saver made it onto the Hooli App Store’s Top 500 (utilities, sub-group mobile, sub-group storage), and FGI’s data was stored on a sufficient number of “devices.” This feat proved the viability of Richard’s new internet and earned Pied Piper funding from Bream-Hall to start building.
            <br><span>The</span> journey to create a decentralized internet has just begun. Keep an eye on <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com/blog" class="underlined">Jared Dunn’s blog</a> for updates on the team’s groundbreaking project.

The next obstacle: securing the patent to the peer-to-peer network Richard dreamed of, which, unfortunately, belonged to Gavin Belson. Gavin and Richard embarked on an unlikely partnership, but it didn’t last long – Belson went to Tibet to find himself, and gave Richard full ownership of the patent.

            <h5><strong>A New Internet</strong></h5>
            <p><span>With</span> Gavin off in Tibet, Richard turned to customers for funding. Pied Piper landed a data storage deal with Fiduciated General Insurance and launched Space Saver, an app to maximize mobile storage that would help build out the Pied Piper network of devices. Space Saver made it onto the Hooli App Store’s Top 500 (utilities, sub-group mobile, sub-group storage), and FGI’s data was stored on a sufficient number of “devices.” This feat proved the viability of Richard’s new internet and earned Pied Piper funding from Bream-Hall to start building.
            <br><span>The</span> journey to create a decentralized internet has just begun. Keep an eye on <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com/blog" class="underlined">Jared Dunn’s blog</a> for updates on the team’s groundbreaking project.

          <p>We’ve accumulated nearly all of the world’s knowledge online, but we forget how much of that data is personal. Today’s Web is dominated by Hooli and a handful of other tech companies that have built their fortunes tracking massive amounts of our data — photos, status updates, location check-ins, web cookies, and more.</p>
          <p>So the question becomes: What do these tech companies do with all of this personal information? So as not to violate several NDAs I was forced to sign upon my exit from Hooli, I can only speak generally: It’s not pretty. They exploit your online activity and preferences for profit. They sell your data to advertisers. You become the product.  </p>
          <p>That’s why we at Pied Piper are building a decentralized internet — one which takes power from these megacorporations and gives it back to you, the netizens.</p>
          <p>Like any great revolution in history, the decentralized internet deserves a thundering manifesto that declaws the powers that be. However, my CEO Richard Hendricks observed that a lighter primer on the benefits of our network might be a better course of action. Ever so wise, Richard! So I reached into my literary toolbox and pulled out my third favorite figure of speech: the metaphor! </p>

At first glance, it may seem an adequate institution, but there are still perils and flaws. Lost books, tracked lending patterns, a narrow view of the Young Adult genre’s broader appeal. It’s time for a change.</p>

      The old Pied Piper “flute player” logo was referencing the fairy-tale character and in no way was meant to suggest a sexual act involving either the mouth or ear of the figure depicted. Apologies to any who were offended, and the logo has been changed to our current hat design by Mary Shibley that's clean, elegant and not without some danger.
